## Stakeholders

Our intended stakeholders are NYU students who use NYU spaces, like libraries, dining halls, or technology centers, for any reason.

### Stakeholders we interviewed: 
Claire is an NYU student who uses NYU reservation systems to quickly find priority seating on campus, to better organize her day, to have access to a place to convene with others, or to find a private spot on campus. Her biggest issue with the current NYU reservation system is its unintuitive interface, and confusing drop-down menus– both of which add a little frustration when trying to navigate through the page. On the other hand, Claire likes knowing the features of the room before she books it, and would like to see the same predictability throughout the redesigned app– with access to real time information about seat availability and busyness. 

Leo is an NYU cas commuter who frequently uses the Bobst reservation system to find places during classes. His most complaints  during weekdays is about how the online reservation is redundant and tedious with a tremendous amount of useless texts and regulations on the selection page. A neat, simple style of user interface would suits better for his experience. He also believes that the current OS are not capable of cancelling previous reservations, which has caused some pain to others. 

James, a computer science talented student, claims that with the increasing demands of private study rooms during school days, it's impossible to reserve a spot that is available within a few hours. He says he has to pre-reserve 2 weeks earlier to get the spot he wanted, which could be very frustrating. James wishes that there could be some improvements like real time data so that he can reserve a certain spot at a certain building according to its capacity and availability within a few hours. That would be a huge relief.

Another comment from a fellow language school student, Tiankai, asserted that a simple reservation system needs not Multi-Factor Authentication for each NYU students since everyone who owns a NYU email should have the access for facilities. Clearing up unnecessary steps would be boon for the user experience compared to what we have now. He also mentions that apart from those who made the reservations, it's hard for others to tell how much time a certain spot is left and when will it become available again. Either showing that information without making the reservation or set up a recommendation spot in the app would be the best.

## Product Vision Statement

NYU students are in need of a comprehensive and unified reservation system for Bobst, dining areas, technology, and classrooms, yet the current implementations are messy and fragmented, so we intend to create an interactive, real-time reservation system to not only unify the system but also add additional needed functionality. 

## User Requirements

### User Stories

- As a student, I want to know which classrooms aren’t in use so I can host a meeting. 

- As a commuter, I want to know which computer labs are open so I can find a place to charge my computer. 

- As a student, I want to see real-time data about multiple NYU buildings, so I can choose which one to go to after class. 

- As a commuter, I want to be able to reserve a single seat so I don't have to use a study room. 

- As a commuter, I want to be able to see predictions for when Bobst is less busy, so I can schedule a meeting in Bobst during that time. 

- As a student, I want reserve any room not currently in use, so I can host a last minute meeting. 

- As a commuter, I want to reserve a single seat in advance so I will have somewhere to sit between classes, reliably.

- As a student, I want to reserve a console so I can play games with friends. 

- As a student, I want to reserve a study space so that I can have a silent study environment.

- As a student, I want to be reserve a VR machine to do my digital art assignment.
