## Stakeholders

Our intended stakeholders are NYU students who use NYU spaces, like libraries, dining halls, or technology centers, for any reason.

### Stakeholders we interviewed: 
Claire is an NYU student who uses NYU reservation systems to quickly find priority seating on campus, to better organize her day, to have access to a place to convene with others, or to find a private spot on campus. Her biggest issue with the current NYU reservation system is its unintuitive interface, and confusing drop-down menus– both of which add a little frustration when trying to navigate through the page. On the other hand, Claire likes knowing the features of the room before she books it, and would like to see the same predictability throughout the redesigned app– with access to real time information about seat availability and busyness.

## User Requirements

### User Stories

- As a student, I want to know which classrooms aren’t in use so I can host a meeting. 

- As a commuter, I want to reserve a seat in advance so I will have somewhere to sit between campus, reliably. 

- As a student, I want to reserve a console so I can play games with friends. 

- As a student, I want to reserve a study space so that I can have a silent study environment.
